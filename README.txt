This is my contribution to a project I was a part of for a while at the University of South Florida.

There are a series of .py files used to make the various structures which can be found in the various folders.

There are also .pdb files which can be opened using PyMol. 

All other files are simply requirements for running molecular simulations using the .pdb files.
